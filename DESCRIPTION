Description: In the unfortunate setting where samples need to be measured in different runs, while the runs themselves can be seen as completely equivalent (no between-run 'batch' effects), the most straightforward way of analysing the data might be by first combining the different runs into one combined file for that subject/condition. Here we automate the catenation of data into one file for flow cytometry data in FCS files, assuming the file names follow a certain pattern: files should end with a space, followed by a number, then an underscore, the position of the sample on the plate (A-H (or a-h) and two numbers), and ".fcs" (or ".FCS").
